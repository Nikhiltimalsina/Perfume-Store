# Login Navigation Setup

## Overview
Successfully added login functionality to the navbar with proper navigation between pages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Navbar Component (`src/components/Navbar.jsx`)
- Added `onLogin` prop to the Navbar component
- Added a new "Login" button next to the "Shop" button
- Styled the login button with a border design to differentiate it from the shop button

### 2. Updated Homepage (`src/pages/Homepage,.jsx`)
- Added `onLogin` prop to the Navbar component usage
- Connected the login button to dispatch `SET_PAGE` action with "login" payload

### 3. Created App Context (`src/App.jsx`)
- Implemented React Context API for state management
- Added routing logic to switch between pages (home, login, shop)
- Created `useApp` hook for accessing app state and dispatch
- Set up `AppWithProvider` wrapper for the main app

### 4. Updated Main Entry Point (`src/main.jsx`)
- Changed to use `AppWithProvider` instead of regular `App` component

### 5. Fixed Import Paths
- Updated all component imports to use correct file paths
- Fixed `FeaturedProduct` vs `FeaturedProducts` naming inconsistency

## How It Works

1. **Navigation Flow:**
   - User clicks "Login" button in navbar
   - `onLogin` function dispatches `SET_PAGE` action with "login" payload
   - App context updates `currentPage` state to "login"
   - App component renders the Login page

2. **Login Page:**
   - User fills in email and password
   - On successful login, dispatches `SET_USER` and `SET_TOKEN` actions
   - Automatically navigates back to home page

3. **State Management:**
   - All page navigation is handled through the App context
   - User authentication state is stored in the context
   - Cart functionality is also managed through the context
